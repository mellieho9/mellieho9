# Hi there 👋

Thank you for visiting my Github profile. I'm thrilled to have you here!

## About Me:
- 🔬 I'm a UI/UX designer and computational researcher, who is interested in Human-Computer Interactions and AI.
- 💻 In my free time, I develop health and productivity apps. My most recent project involves building [a web application that allows people to make conscious traveling decisions and contribute to medical research through an ill-ness exposure dashboard, AI-powered health tracking and diagnosis tool, and SMS survey](https://devpost.com/software/feel-track). 
- 👩🏻 My pronouns - She/her/hers.

## I'm Currently Working On:
- Completing LinkedIn Learning's [Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms in Java](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/introduction-to-data-structures-algorithms-in-java)
- Completing deeplearning.ai's [AI for Medicine specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine) 

## Fun Facts:
- 📚 I'm a part-time tutor in STEM. My enjoyment with teaching originates from my desire to generate my personal income and help my peers reach their personal goals.
- 🔭 When I'm not coding, I visit museums and small startups. My favorite place so far is Air Company's Headquarters. As a person who believes that good ideas come from exaptation, I'm fascinated by the startup's idea to repurpose carbon dioxide into creating perfumes, air spray, and even vodka!
- 🗞 By the same token, I am avid follower of science news. I would recommend VERSE and Quanta Magazine for anyone who is interested!
