# Hi there 👋

Thank you for visiting my Github profile. I'm thrilled to have you here!

## About Me:
- 🔬 I'm a UI/UX designer and computational researcher, who is interested in Human-Computer Interactions and AI.
- 💻 In my free time, I develop health and productivity apps. My most recent project involves building [a Web3 application that gives people the choice to sell their health-tracking data, in exchange for cryptocurrency and lifestyle suggestions](https://devpost.com/software/altru). 
- 👩🏻 My pronouns - She/her/hers.

## I'm Currently Working On:
- Completing deeplearning.ai's ["AI for Medicine specialization"] (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-for-medicine) 
- Learning how to implement Automatic differentiation for my [voltammetry parameter inference model project](https://github.com/mellieho9/Voltammogram-Parameter-Inference) 

## Fun Facts:
- 📚 I'm a part-time tutor in STEM. My enjoyment with teaching originates from my desire to generate my personal income and help my peers reach their personal goals.
- 🔭 When I'm not coding, I visit museums and small startups. My favorite place so far is Air Company's Headquarters. As a person who believes that good ideas come from exaptation, I'm fascinated by the startup's idea to repurpose carbon dioxide into creating perfumes, air spray, and even vodka!
- 🗞 By the same token, I am avid follower of science news. To get the latest scoop, I take part in my college's STEM magazine and research journal, as a layout designer and peer reviewer!
