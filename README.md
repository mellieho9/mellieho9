# Hi there 👋

Thank you for visiting my Github profile. I'm thrilled to have you here!

## About Me:
- 🔬 I'm a UI/UX designer and computational researcher, who is interested in Human-Computer Interactions, AI, and developing technology for good.
- 💻 In my free time, I develop health and productivity apps. My most recent project involves building [a journal that quantitatively and qualitatively measures the user's stress level to provide appropriate mental health recommendations](https://devpost.com/software/neuro-journal). 
- 👩🏻 My pronouns - She/her/hers.

## I'm Currently Working On:
- Leading 4 students through developing a tool used by the logistic team to extract information from 35 Devpost projects and match each project with the appropriate judges (Python, urllib, Beautiful Soup, Google Drive API).
- Implementing a responsive page presenting during-event information to 100+ hackers (Google Maps API, HTML, CSS).

## Fun Facts:
- 📚 I'm a part-time tutor in STEM. My enjoyment with teaching originates from my desire to generate my personal income and help my peers reach their personal goals.
- 🔭 When I'm not coding, I visit museums and small startups. My favorite place so far is Air Company's Headquarters. As a person who believes that good ideas come from exaptation, I'm fascinated by the startup's idea to repurpose carbon dioxide into creating perfumes, air spray, and even vodka!
- 🗞 By the same token, I am avid follower of science news. I would recommend VERSE and Quanta Magazine for anyone who is interested!
