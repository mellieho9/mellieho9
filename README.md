# Hi there 👋

Thank you for visiting my Github profile. I'm thrilled to have you here!

## About Me:
- 🔬 I'm a UI/UX designer and computational researcher, who is interested in Human-Computer Interactions and AI.
- 💻 In my free time, I develop wellness and productivity apps catering to niche populations. My most recent project involves conceptualizing [a financial assistant tool for cognition-declining elders](https://devpost.com/software/finnacle-16vxg2). 
- 👩🏻 My pronouns - She/her/hers.

## I'm Currently Working On:
- Building a simple cyclic voltammetry simulation for [a voltammetry parameter inference model](https://github.com/mellieho9/Voltammogram-Parameter-Inference) 
- Building another version of the bioinformatics-learning platform [Rosalind](https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/) for Computational Chemistry students

## Fun Facts:
- 📚 I'm a part-time tutor in English, SAT, and Computer Science. My enjoyment with teaching originates from my desire to generate my own source of income and help my students reach their personal goals.
- 🔭 When I'm not coding, I visit museums and small startups. My favorite place so far is Air Company's Headquarters. As a person who believes that good ideas come from exaptation, I'm fascinated by the startup's idea to repurpose carbon dioxide into creating perfumes, air spray, and even vodka!
- 🗞 By the same token, I am avid follower of science news. To get the latest scoop, I'm a part of my college's STEM magazine and research journal!
