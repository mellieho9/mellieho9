# Hi there 👋

Thank you for visiting my Github profile. I'm thrilled to have you here!

## About Me:
- 🔬 I'm a computational researcher and full-stack developer who is interested in Human-Computer Interactions, AI, and developing technology for good.
- 💻 I take self-learning seriously. I use my free time to expand my tech stack through CodeAcademy as well as building hackathon/personal projects. This semester, I am learning advanced IOS development as an apprentice at App Team Carolina, data visualization and cloud database to deliver a solution for the Environmental Educators of North Carolina,and and Material UI/Context API through building my [first messenger app](https://github.com/mellieho9/Tawk)
- 👩🏻 Other words to describe me: Overplanner, enthusiastic, creative, and workaholic.

## I'm Currently Working On:
- Applying for Summer 2023 internships!
- Learning and building full-stack iOS products as an apprentice at App Team Carolina
- Delivering a data visualization dashboard for the Environmental Educators of North Carolina
- Developing an algorithm to summarize / generate interactive dialogues from Ego4D video datasets + Overseeing the development of a visualization dashboard for the Parkinson project at UNC's Computer Vision lab.
- Analyzing preliminary survey data for a startup project with a student at Harvard Business School.

## Fun Facts:
- 📚 My long-term trajectory is to pursue a pHD in AI. I am just amazed at how AI can be used to address so many problems and am overseeing research projects to discover what I want to concentrate on in the future.
- 🔭 When I'm not coding, I visit museums and small startups. My favorite place so far is Air Company's Headquarters. As a person who believes that good ideas come from exaptation, I'm fascinated by the startup's idea to repurpose carbon dioxide into creating perfumes, air spray, and even vodka!
- 🗞 By the same token, I am avid follower of science news. I would recommend VERSE and Quanta Magazine for anyone who is interested!
